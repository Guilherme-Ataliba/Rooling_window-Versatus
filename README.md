# Symbolic Regression Rolling Window - Time Series
This repository consists of a study of the applicability of machine learning, symbolic regression (SR) algorithms (for more information look ![here](https://github.com/Guilherme-Ataliba/CSOWP-Symbolic-Regression)) in time series data.

The original idea was to understand if SR algorithms can extract some information from the signal that could help make predictions and acertions about the problem.

## Results

### 1. Test Data
Different problems and time series were tested, to find out the method's performance across different scenarios

### 2. Rolling Windows Algorithm
Preview of the rolling window algorithm fitting the symbolic regression model in each interval.

### 3. Partial Analysis 
Results obtained for the airplanes data, where it is possible to observe a convergence of different solution in a small region around the fitted interval.
